- fix vertical camera movement
* add multiply sectors support
  + display and camera move
  + steps per sector
  - move objects across sectors
    + emit migrate event on target sector (simple but wrong)
    + emit migrate event on current sector
    - be able to follow camera with object on dev-view
- do not wait for step from all clients, emit steps on server
  - freeze while waiting for migrations?
  - async compare hashes
- mechanism to enforce rules across sectors
  e.g. having only one tank to control
- add async calls support
- add network support
